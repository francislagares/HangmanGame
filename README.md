# Hangman Game in JAVA

This is my first basic program in JAVA. The Hangman game where you must input one letter at a time in the console and have a limited number of attempts. If you manage to complete the entire word, you win otherwise if you run out of attempts the game is over.

## Basic Fundamentals of the language I use

- Scanner class
- Declarations and assignments
- Arrays
- Control structure: Iterative (Loop)
- String class and its methods valueOf, charAt, and length()
- Character class and its method toLowerCase
- Control structure: Conditional

The compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
